    "   - [Resample](https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream.resample.html): Changes the sampling rate of the data. Typical sampling rates are around 100 Hz, which may be too high for analyses. We tend to **downsample data** to make it easier to work with.\n",
    "   - [Detrend](https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.trace.Trace.detrend.html): Detrending removes linear or polynomial trends from data. Seismologists may only consider a few hours of data at a time. Long period (>1 hour) trends are therefore not needed in the analysis, and can often obscure other parts of the waveform.   \n",
    "   - [Taper](https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.trace.Trace.taper.html): Tapering \"rounds off\" the beginning and end of our signals. Seismic data are continuous, and signals prior to an earthquake origin time, or after the end of the surface wave train, may not be desired during analysis. Additionally, many of the signal processing techniques we perform require that data start and end at zero amplitude. \n",
    "   - [Rotate](https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream.rotate.html): Re-orient the seismometer geographically. Seismometers record on three othogonal components, and seismologists can \"choose\" how to orient these components in space. Common coordinate systems include North-South, East-West, and Vertical (ZNE), as well as Radial, Transverse, Vertical (RTZ). RTZ rotations are **event-dependent**, meaning the radial direction is in line with the great-circle path between event and receiver.\n",
