Try to find representative numbers for your example (approximate density, wavespeed layer thickness etc. to justify your thinking), and in words discuss what the setup would be, what approximate material parameters would be, how fast you might expect Love waves to propagate, and at what wavelengths.

    "\n",
    "#### Data Download\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you are downloading data using `Client.get_waveforms()` and `Client.get_stations()`, you are making a query to an online webservice.\n",
    "- You will need an internet connection to make this request. Larger time series will take longer to download.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving Data\n",
    "- Data is stored in RAM but not on disk. If you want to save your data for offline use, you may use the `Stream.write()` function.\n",
    "- Seismic data is typically saved in [MiniSEED](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/miniseed/) (\"MSEED\") format\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wildcards\n",
    "- We often use [wildcards](https://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/x11655.htm) to make our data requests more general. `?` means one of any number of letter and `*` means any length of numbers and letters\n",
    "- For example, if I request `NZ.BHZ.*.BH?`, I am asking for any component (typically 'BHN', 'BHZ', 'BHE') and any location code (typically 00, 10, 20 etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filtering\n",
    "- Filtering in ObsPy happens **in-place**. That means your original data is no long recoverable unless you have copied it beforehand.\n",
    "- When using ObsPy, be careful about **in-place** operations on data, where some processing step affects your data directly, rather than creating a modified copy. \n",
    "- In order to save data you can use the `.copy()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "st = c.get_waveforms(...)\n",
    "st_original = st.copy()  # this now stores your raw waveform data\n",
    "st.filter(...)  # `st` is now filtered and raw data is only accessible in `st_original`\n",
    "# Some processing here\n",
    "st = st_original.copy()  # if you want to \"undo\" all your processing, you can copy the raw data back \n",

    "   d. Rotate the seismograms from ZNE to RTZ using `Stream.rotate()` (Be careful about which azimuth you use here. Remember that Lecture 5 had a useful diagram.)  \n",

    "   d. Using the distance you calculated previously, calculate the velocity of each of the arriving groups. Make sure you're consistent with what points you're choosing to call \"arrival\"   \n",
    "   e. Make a list of period **T** and associated group velocity $U$.  \n",
    "   f. Make a plot of group velocities $U$ versus period $T$ for the Love wave.\n",

    "   b. For each central period, plot the filtered Love wave seismogram. You should have 6 different waveform figures.  \n",
    "   c. As in the previous part, eyeball an arrival time and make a plot of group velocity versus central period. Consider the max amplitude of each waveform to be the \"arrival\" of this packet of energy.  \n",
    "   d. Describe what you see in the two figures you have made. In your description, answer the following questions:\n",
    "    - Your dispersion curve figure should look a bit strange compared to a typical dispersion curve. Which periods do not conform to the typical look (i.e., if you removed those data points, the curve would look normal)  \n",
    "    - Those dispersion data points are from arrivals of real packets of energy, and are telling us that we are measuring something different. Describe what we are measuring.  \n",
