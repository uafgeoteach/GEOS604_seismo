    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework assignment is meant to give you some intuition of waves, their key properties, and two classic solutions to the wave equation, the harmonic wave solution (traveling waves), and the standing wave/normal mode solution.  Some things I want this homework to build your intuition and familiarity on are:\n",
    "1. The 1D wave equation\n",
    "2. Common solutions to the wave equation (travelling and standing waves) and their superpositions\n",
    "3. Reflection and transmission behaviors, dictated by the 1D wave equation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember from the lecture that we derived the 1D wave equation looking at the forces acting on a string, and asking how a displaced string would respond to these forces in space and time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u(x, t)}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u(x, t)}{\\partial t^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The velocity $v$ that we derived for the string is dependent on the  material ($\\rho$) and the tension applied to the string: $v=\\sqrt{\\tau/\\rho}$.  \n",
    "- In lecture we saw that two solutions to the wave equation came in the form of travelling waves, and standing waves."
